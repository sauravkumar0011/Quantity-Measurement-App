/**
 * ConnectionPool
 *
 * ConnectionPool class manages a pool of database connections for efficient reuse.
 * It initializes a specified number of connections based on the configuration and
 * provides methods to acquire and release connections. The pool ensures that the
 * number of active connections does not exceed the configured pool size and handles
 * connection creation and closure gracefully. It also provides methods to retrieve
 * pool statistics for monitoring purposes.
 *
 * The ConnectionPool class is designed to be a singleton, ensuring that only one
 * instance of the connection pool exists throughout the application. This design
 * allows for centralized management of database connections. The class uses JDBC
 * for connection management and includes error handling to manage exceptions that
 * may occur during connection creation and closure.
