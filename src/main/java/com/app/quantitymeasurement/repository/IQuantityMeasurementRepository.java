/**
 * IQuantityMeasurementRepository
 *
 * Repository interface for managing QuantityMeasurementEntity objects.
 *
 * This interface defines the contract for data access operations related to quantity
 * measurement entities. It abstracts the persistence mechanism so that the service
 * layer does not depend on implementation details of storage.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface may store data using:
 * - In-memory cache (QuantityMeasurementCacheRepository)
 * - Database storage via JDBC (QuantityMeasurementDatabaseRepository)
 *
 * UC16 enhancements over UC15:
 * - Added getMeasurementsByOperation() for filtering by operation type
 * - Added getMeasurementsByType() for filtering by measurement category
 * - Added getTotalCount() for reporting and monitoring
 * - Added deleteAll() for test isolation and state reset
 * - Added default methods for pool statistics and resource cleanup
 *
 * This design follows the Repository Pattern and supports loose coupling between
 * the Service Layer and the data persistence layer.
